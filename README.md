**A custom VirtualBox fork to bypass VM detection mechanisms**

![GitHub all releases](https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/PravinChoudhary11/VM-Bypass-By-Pravin/total?style=for-the-badge)

## 🚀 Overview

**VM-Bypass-By-Pravin** is a modified version of VirtualBox aimed at **evading virtual machine detection** typically used by **proctoring software**, **anti-cheat systems**, and **malware sandboxes**. This project helps developers and researchers run virtual environments without being flagged or restricted by detection systems.

Inspired by the research and work of [Vektor T13](https://detect.expert/), this fork brings **stealth-level VM concealment** to desktop virtualization.

🔧 **Still working in 2025!**
